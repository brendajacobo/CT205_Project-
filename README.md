# CST 205 Team 5 Repository
## Description
Our project is a Spotify song suggestor which will analyze whether you look happy or sad and recommend appropriate songs to you. 
## Challenges
The biggest challenge our app faced was how fragmented it was. We have a flask application which needs to "listen" to a face detection app.
## Running the app
- Clone the master branch of this repository.
- Retrieve the key information for your Spotify API application and put it in a file called conf.json
- Launch the app using 'python app.py' from the /spotify directory.
